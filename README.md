# Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project develops an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques to classify network traffic as either normal or malicious. It utilizes the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, which contains labeled network connections, including various attack types.

## Key Components

- **Dataset**: The KDD Cup 1999 dataset with 494,021 instances and 43 features representing different network connections.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves cleaning, normalizing, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.

- **Modeling**: Several machine learning algorithms are applied, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Models are evaluated based on their accuracy and training/testing times to determine effectiveness in classifying network attacks.

## Conclusion

The IDS successfully identifies different types of attacks, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in enhancing network security.
